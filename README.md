# orgdot-webfonts
NPM packages to easily self-host Orgdot web fonts.
https://primaveraentalca.github.io/orgdot-webfonts

## Requirements
You need to have webpack setup to load CSS and font files.<br />For many tools built with Webpack such as [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby") and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), it should work out-of-the-box.<br />Also tested with [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) bundler.

## Fonts
To see all the other fonts check the **packages** directory or visit the project's site [here](https://primaveraentalca.github.io/orgdot-webfonts).

## About
I'm NOT the owner of these fonts.<br />These are the collective work of the [Orgdot Consortium](http://www.orgdot.com).
I generated the web fonts from [this files](http://www.orgdot.com/aliasfonts/index.htm) using [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org).
The idea of publishing npm packages for easy self-hosting comes from the [Typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) project.
