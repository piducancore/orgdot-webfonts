# orgdot-swfitslmfw
The CSS and web font files to easily self-host Orgdot swfit_slm_fw.

## Requirements
You need to have webpack setup to load CSS and font files.<br />For many tools built with Webpack such as [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby") and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), it should work out-of-the-box.<br />Also tested with [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) bundler.

## Install
First, install like any other package<br />`npm install --save orgdot-swfitslmfw`

## Usage
Require the package in your entry file.<br />`require('orgdot-swfitslmfw')`

Then, use the font in your styles<br />`font-family: 'swfit_slm_fw';`

## About
I'm NOT the owner of these fonts.<br />These are the collective work of the [Orgdot Consortium](http://www.orgdot.com).
I generated the web fonts from [this files](http://www.orgdot.com/aliasfonts/index.htm) using [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org).
The idea of publishing npm packages for easy self-hosting comes from the [Typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) project.
